## General info
This project is completely build with python. The sole aim is to create a basic game only with python and test it's smoothness. You will love playing this.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7 or higher (3.8.5 recommended)
* pygame module version: 1.9.6
* any IDE can be used but VS Code is recommended.
	
## Setup
To run this project, fisrt install python from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).
After successful installation of python, install pygame module using pip command.
```

```
Now you are good to go. Having knowledge on pygame is an added benefit but you can use google for any need as I did.

## Features!

  - Smooth experience with good user interaction.
  - Indication for whose turn or who will choose.


You can also:
  - Minimize or close the game any time you want.
  - Can close it by double tapping in the game status bar.


## Status
This project is finished for the time being. But if some idea comes up to my mind this will be reflected into it.

## Inspiration
I got my main inspiration at looking at different pygame functions and classes and want to recreat the my childhood games through Python.
